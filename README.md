This project is a responsive blog website created from a design in Figma. The primary focus of this project was to practice and solidify skills in modern CSS layout techniques, specifically responsive design, Flexbox, and CSS Grid.

Figma Design File

**Key Concepts Applied:**

* **Responsive Web Design:** Implemented mobile-first design principles to ensure the layout adapts smoothly across various screen sizes, from small mobile devices to large desktop screens.
* **CSS Flexbox:** Utilized Flexbox for aligning items and creating flexible one-dimensional layouts, particularly for components like the header, navigation, and article content sections.
* **CSS Grid:** Employed CSS Grid for creating the main two-dimensional page structure, allowing for precise control over the placement of the main content and sidebar elements.

**Learning Journey Highlight:**

The main goal of this project was to translate a professional design from Figma into a fully functional and responsive website. It was an excellent opportunity to apply CSS Flexbox and Grid in a practical context. The challenge lay in deciding when to use Flexbox versus Grid and combining them effectively to achieve the desired layout. This project was instrumental in building confidence in creating complex, responsive layouts that are common in modern web development.
